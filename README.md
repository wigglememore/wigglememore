## Welcome!

Hi, Iâ€™m @wigglememore, I enjoy programming as a hobby, primarily in Python and Fortran.  My long term goal is to write a finite-volume based CFD code in Fortran which is why you'll probably see lots of unfinished attempts at simple problems like 1D diffusion.

I also enjoy skiing, climbing, yoga, tennis, rowing and 3D printing.  You can find my website here [wigglememre3d](www.wigglememore3d.com).
